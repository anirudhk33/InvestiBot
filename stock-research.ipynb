       "'Term Labs today launches its fixed-rate lending protocol on Ethereum. Term Finance is a milestone towards the development of a more mature crypto market, one with rules more familiar to TradFi lenders and borrowers than current Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols.  Variable rates are the current rule in DeFi, making it riskier for large professional portfolios to get on board. Interest rates on protocols like Aave and Compound are calculated according to supply and demand. So, if a crypto whale deposits a boatload of funds into a lending pool, rates across the board will plummet in accordance with the abundance of supply, and vice versa.  The Term team channeled the U.S. Treasury for inspiration, specifically its auction calendar model, which matches borrowers and lenders who have set predetermined rates. The collateral is then locked up in a smart contract for the duration of the auction, aka the loan’s term.  Tether Reports $850 Million Q2 Profit, $72 Billion Exposure to US Treasuries Term Finance promises zero slippage—an occurrence where the expected price of a trade is different from the final price after the trade has been executed. It also promises no spread, which is when two listed prices (commonly buy and sell) are different.  In addition, the team hopes investors and traders will be lured by low fees and high-quality blue chip collateral like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins by Circle and Tether  Back in February, Term Labs raised $2.5 million to build the lending platform. The funding round was led by Electric Capital and included contributions from Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Robot Ventures, and Mexc Ventures.  Billy Welch, Term Labs’ co-founder confirmed with Decrypt that Term Finance will branch out into other blockchains and layer-2 solutions “shortly after” the first launch on Ethereum. While no dates were given, Welch said the protocol “will be multi-chain soon.” The “most popular” lending and borrowing activities among the 2,000 testnet users and private mainnet beta was, according to Welch, borrowing stablecoins against liquid staking tokens (LSTs), in particular Lido Finance’s wrapped stETH.  People also borrowed Tether against USDC “as the borrowing rate on Tether can be very volatile” and, Welch says, borrowing ETH against LSTs will be a popular transaction “to enhance staking yields.”  Why Ethereum Bulls Are Turning to LSD The shortest duration of loan will be four weeks, but Welch envisions the 1- and 3-month'"

Futures on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slumped 0.5% before the open. A plethora of earnings added mixed sentiments to what has been a bullish mood for most of 2023 so far. Of note, Caterpillar (CAT) warned of a coming slowdown in its business; Pfizer (PFE) trimmed the upper end of its revenue forecast; Uber (UBER) popped after posting a surprise profit. These earnings serve as the appetizer for the main event: second quarter results from Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) that are due out Thursday. Both stocks are up more than 50% so far this year.

The Street responded critically. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) analysts called the news a setback for the company. Lotiglipron — the disregarded candidate — was expected to be the stronger contender. Meanwhile, SVB Securities labeled the decision “incrementally negative,” according to Yahoo! Finance. Still, Pfizer is pressing on with its plan to advance the twice-daily pill while also researching a once-daily variant. And Pfizer’s dividend yield stands out — a robust 4.56%. Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup. This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities. Here's how you can be among the first to buy shares. So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $131,579, or 3,635 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $26,315, or 727 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend yield (0.046 in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0456 = $131,579 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / 0.0456 = $26,315 ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price. For example, if a stock pays an\",\n",

The pharmaceutical industry is one that has profited a lot from the computing revolution. Throughout the years, and especially in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, a handful of biotechnology stocks have soared. For instance, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), one of the manufacturers of the coronavirus vaccine, has seen its shares jump by 661% in the past five years despite the fact that they are now trading at roughly $105 - levels significantly below the late 2021 peak which saw the share price touch nearly $400. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s shares have grown by slightly less, but like BioNTech, have dropped from what were perhaps record high levels in 2021. On a broader level, the pharmaceutical industry is made up of both biotechnology companies and giants such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). These companies have market capitalizations in hundreds of billions of dollars and they sell pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products.

The earnings season for the Medical sector kicked off around mid-July when bellwether Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. It beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. All three segments, Pharmaceutical, MedTech and Consumer Health, delivered a strong performance in the quarter, gaining from solid demand trends. Among the biotechs, Biogen and GSK plc reported their second-quarter results last week, where both companies beat earnings and revenues estimates. Biogen maintained its previously issued financial outlook for 2023, while GSK raised the same. The Earnings Trends\\xa0report indicates that as of Jul 26, 17.2% of the companies in the Medical sector — representing 35.2% of the sector’s market capitalization — reported quarterly earnings. Of these, 90% have outperformed on both earnings and revenues. Earnings increased 3.1% year over year, while revenues increased 12.8%. Overall, second-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 31.2%, while sales are expected to rise 3.3% from the year-ago quarter. Pfizer\\xa0PFE, Merck MRK, Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, Exelixis EXEL and Incyte INCY are scheduled to release second-quarter earnings on Aug 1.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -70.6%. Revenues are expected to be $13.89 billion, down 49.9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.24% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

CEO Elon Musk's vision for the company centers around a future where cars drive themselves and intelligent bots replace human labor. It may seem far-fetched today, but the seeds are planted for 2030 and beyond, and arguably no company has the opportunity in front of it that Tesla does. Here is why Tesla could be one of the world's five largest companies by 2030. Tesla's full self-driving technology (FSD) is the foundation for the company's long-term growth. The company began fitting all models with the required hardware for FSD in 2016 and released a beta program to the public in 2020. The company's been monitoring its customers since then, collecting more than 150 million miles of FSD driving data to hone its software and continue improving FSD technology.

       "  \"Road Town, BVI, July 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTC PROXY, the leading DeFi protocol designed for BTC holders, is excited to announce a strategic partnership with MPCVault, a leading secure multi-signature custody solutions provider. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in BTC PROXY's ongoing vision to develop the most transparent and decentralized Bitcoin DeFi protocol. BTC PROXY has already established itself as a pioneer in the DeFi space, offering insured custody of BTC through trusted partnerships with industry-leading custodians such as Binance Custody, Gemini Trust, Hex Trust, and Fireblocks. As the industry shifts away from centralized organizations towards more transparent and decentralized solutions, BTC Proxy has joined forces with MPCVault to provide select institutions with an option for self-custody. The partnership enables these institutions to utilize multi-signature permissions, allowing for enhanced security to hold their Bitcoin in fully viewable wallets on the blockchain. Through this collaboration, partners will have the opportunity to deposit their Bitcoin into MPCVault-integrated wallets within the BTC Proxy protocol, which, in turn, will mint BTCpx tokens for use within DeFi. This process ensures that partners can monitor their Bitcoin holdings within the user-friendly GUI as well as on the blockchain. The multi-signature process allows for secure withdrawal and removal of Bitcoin with a majority quorum, ensuring enhanced security. Centralized platforms and insecure protocols have long been a challenge for DeFi, often leading to closures and hacks that result in losing users' funds. By partnering with MPCVault, BTC PROXY aims to provide BTC holders with a seamless solution to transfer their Bitcoin onto DeFi, including the upcoming Redux protocol. Redux is an on-chain Bitcoin borrowing and lending protocol designed to offer permissionless access to Bitcoin for institutions and users, further enriching the DeFi ecosystem.

In a recent market update note, Singapore-based QCP Capital said this is the season of accumulators. Despite BTC and ETH's indifferent response to macroeconomic factors and their current sideways trading, the market anticipates a rise in volatility and a possible significant BTC price increase by year's end due to factors like the Blackrock spot ETF ruling and the Bitcoin Halving, with Accumulators emerging as an effective strategy for accredited investors to acquire coins at discounted prices steadily, they wrote. Elsewhere, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz recently said in an interview with Bloomberg that “the most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink,” emphasizing his bullishness about the world’s largest digital currency post-ETF filing. “Larry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, ‘Hey, this is going to be a global currency.’ People around the world all trust it,” Novogratz said, while also mentioning that Galaxy Digital is committed to maintaining a presence in New York. Novogratz also said that his ideal portfolio for a young person with risk tolerance is shares of Alibaba, silver, gold, bitcoin, and ether. Meanwhile, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, said bitcoin’s ability to shrug off macroeconomic events, or even material technical events like the Curve Finance exploit, has created a recent “sustained sentiment shift” to the upside in the markets. “Notably, now that the Fed's interest rate hike is also priced, the fact that Bitcoin and ETH have both maintained their price levels, should give bulls additional confidence,” DiPasquale wrote\",\n",

The hack has been linked to a flaw in a programming language. These concerns increased as reports surfaced on Tuesday of an attack on the LeetSwap exchange running on Coinbase. Solana and Matic led the top 10 losers mid Tuesday. Litecoin also gave up gains ahead of its halving event on Wednesday. Bitcoin fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours to US$28,872 as of 12:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell under the US$30,000 support floor in the latter weeks of July and has fluctuated around US$29,000 since then, unable to find buying support for a breakout in the so-called summer doldrums when trading in many capital markets slows. However, drama came over the weekend when decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve Finance reported a security issue in older versions of Vyper, the programming language used for smart contracts. According to data from smart contract auditing firm BlockSec, hackers drained an estimated US$41 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform as a result of the malfunction, raising concerns about possible problems at other DeFi platforms. Curve Finance is the third largest decentralized financial exchange (DEX) by 7-day trading volume, according to DeFi data tracker DefiLlama. Bitcoin and Ether lost ground as CoinDesk reported that LeetSwap said its working with on-chain security experts to recover 340 Ether after PeckShield tweeted the exchange on Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain had been attacked.

The largest digital asset by market capitalization was recently trading at $29,904, up 0.3%. Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, remained largely unfazed during the day, lingering at around its weekly low below $1,900. Major alternative cryptocurrencies – so-called altcoins – including SOL and XRP recovered some of their losses endured earlier in the day.

The decision bolstered the view of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the plaintiff in both cases. The US regulator has argued certain cryptocurrencies are securities and therefore should be overseen by the SEC, using that assertion as the basis for several lawsuits against major industry players. US crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN), which faces one such lawsuit from the SEC, dropped as much as 8.5% Tuesday. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) also fell below $29,000. The new decision that upended stocks came from US Judge Jed Rakoff in the Southern District of New York, who opposed an earlier ruling from Analisa Torres, another judge in the same US district court. Torres had concluded in mid July that the XRP digital token issued by Ripple Labs was a security only when it was sold to institutional investors, and not when it was purchased by the general public. Rakoff disagreed with that specific view in his case, in which the SEC has alleged stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs sold unregistered securities. \"The Court rejects the approach recently adopted by another judge of this District,\" he wrote. The disagreement was a blow to some in the crypto world who had hailed the earlier ruling from Torres. \"Well, it was a fun few weeks,\" Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel for digital asset research and consulting firm Delphi Labs.

       "  'In Tuesday’s trading session, the euro experienced a pullback, raising questions about the potential strength of the US dollar and whether this is a temporary retracement. Market participants are closely monitoring the situation, especially as the Federal Reserve meeting later this week could introduce heightened volatility. This article delves into the current state of the euro and its potential trajectory in light of these market dynamics. The euro’s recent pullback has placed the spotlight on the critical psychological support level at 1.10. Previous price action has demonstrated the significant influence this level holds over the euro’s direction. As traders weigh their options, this support area is likely to attract value hunters seeking opportunities to capitalize on what they perceive as “cheap euros.” If these traders reenter the market, it may lead to a push towards the formidable resistance zone at 1.1250. Should the euro breach the 1.1250 resistance level decisively, it could pave the way for further gains towards the 1.15 mark. Such a scenario might trigger a “fear of missing out” sentiment among traders, prompting them to jump on board the upward trend. However, market participants must exercise caution, given the anticipated volatility introduced by the impending Federal Reserve meeting. The Federal Reserve’s decisions have historically had a substantial impact on the euro-dollar relationship. Often referred to as the “anti-dollar,” the euro tends to weaken when the US dollar gains strength and vice versa. With both central banks playing a crucial role in shaping their respective currencies, market noise has intensified, and volatility is expected to remain high in the foreseeable future. Given the heightened market turbulence, traders should exercise prudence in their position sizing. The unpredictable nature of the euro’s near-term trajectory suggests that initiating short positions might be less favorable. Instead, market participants are focusing on identifying',\n",

The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Adobe’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.  View our latest analysis for Adobe  According to my valuation model, Adobe seems to be fairly priced at around 7.89% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Adobe today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $490.18, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Adobe’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity. Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

Irrespective of whether it is a start-up or a well-known company, earnings growth is the main priority for any organization. This is because if the company doesn't make money, it won't last in the long run. So, what's earnings growth? Study a company's revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings play a noteworthy role. Frequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations. Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm. Thus, investors should be on the lookout for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates. The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 29.
